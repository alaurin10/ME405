# Pen Plotter

## Overview

The goal of this project was to create a pen plotter with 2.5 degrees of freedom. That is, a pen plotter capable of drawing on 
a 2D plane (2 degrees of freedom) with an additional pen-up and pen-down movement (half a degree of freedom). This design was 
a compact two arm linkage which was actuated by two stepper motors and a scissor lift.
